            <p>
                Cage aquaculture involves the growing of fishes in existing water resources while being enclosed in a net cage which allows free flow of water. It is an aquaculture production system made of a floating frame, net materials and mooring system (with rope, buoy, anchor etc.) with a round or square shape floating net to hold and culture large number of fishes and can be installed in reservoir, river, lake or sea. A catwalk and handrail is built around a battery of floating cages. There are 4 types of fish-rearing cages namely: i) Fixed cages, ii) Floating cages, iii) Submerged cages and iv) Submersible cages. Economically speaking, cage culture is a low impact farming practice with high returns and least carbon emission activity. Farming of fish in an existing water body removes one of the biggest constraints of fish farming on land, ie.,  the need for a constant flow of clean, oxygenated water. Cage farms are positioned in a such way to utilize natural currents, which provide the fish with oxygen and other appropriate natural conditions.

In view of the high production attainable in cage culture system, it can play a significant role in increasing the overall fish production in India. Suitable locations in Indian’s long coastline, vast brackish water areas available in coastal states and other underutilized water bodies can be better utilized by adopting cage culture. Since the investment is low and requires very little / no land area, this farming method is ideal for small scale fisherfolks as an alternative income source. This can be taken up as an household / women activity since labour involved is minimal and can be managed by a small family. The design of the cage and its accessories can be tailor-made in accordance to the individual farmer’s requirements.
